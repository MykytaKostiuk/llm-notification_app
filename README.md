# LLM Notification App

A project dedicated to building intelligent notification systems using LangGraph, LangChain, and Large Language Models (LLMs) for educational purposes.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of modern AI technologies to create smart notification systems. It serves as a learning resource for understanding how to leverage LLMs in practical applications.

## Technologies

- **LangChain**: Framework for developing applications powered by language models
- **LangGraph**: Library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs
- **LLMs**: Large Language Models for intelligent content generation and processing

## Purpose

This repository is designed for educational exploration of:

- Building notification systems with AI capabilities
- Understanding LangGraph workflow patterns
- Implementing LangChain components
- Practical LLM integration techniques

## Getting Started
